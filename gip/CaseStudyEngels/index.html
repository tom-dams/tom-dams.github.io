  <div class="post">
    <p>This review is going to be about the tool System Center Configuration Manager.
System Center Configuration Manager is mostly used for companies which are not small enough to keep track of every PC with a spreadsheet anymore.
With System Center Configuration Manager you can put these PCs in groups to identify the PCs.
You can also linkTask Sequences to each group which makes it easier and quicker to boot PCs.
In these task sequences you can choose what Operating System, which drivers, what software and much more you want.
Like this you only have to choose this once and you can boot multiple PCs the same way with just one press on a button.
When you do this all the PCs will have the same software, OS … and each PC will be able to do just the same as all the other PCs in that group. This was used a lot at Etap where I did my internship. For instance I made a Task Sequence for all their laptops that had to go in the meeting rooms. These laptops had to do the exact same thing so I just had to boot them all with that Task Sequence and they were all done.  You can also bind one Task Sequence to multiple groups.</p>

<p>First of all the product is really useful for companies that are growing in terms of employees.
The review does a pretty good job of showing this by giving us some examples of how it could go down in a real company.
It’s useful for organizing every device and easy to keep up with new employees.
You can easily put a new device in a group when a new employee needs to be added.
If you already used an older version of this tool, you’re in luck because you can easily import the data from one version to the other.
However, if you didn’t, it’s going to take you some time to set everything up.
If this is the case I’d still highly recommend doing this since it’s going to save you some time afterwards.
It’s an investment of time. You’re going to lose a lot of time when you start with it but it’s going to save you way more time afterwards.</p>

<p>I really like this tool.
I’d really recommend it to every company that’s struggling with keeping up with the administration of their PCs.
At first sight it looks pretty complicated but once you look into it for a while it is actually pretty easy to understand and it’s going to save you a lot of time.</p>
